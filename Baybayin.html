        <h3> 1620 - Krus-Kudlit is created</h3>
        <p>During Spanish colonialism, colonizers had a hard time using Baybayin. The script was syllabic, which the Spaniards struggled with, as Latin script was alphabetic. To remedy this, they introduced the Krus-Kudlit, a small Virama symbol, which was added to characters to terminate the vowels. <br> <br> The first instance of its use was In 1620, by Fr. Francisco Lopez in a Chatecism book, which was also the first instance of Ilocano written in Baybayin.</p>

        <p>This raised issues of regionalism as Baybayin is not the only writing system in the country. In fact, unlike Baybayin, some of these writing systems are still actively being used and have not been replace by Latin script despite centuries of colonialism.</p>

        <h3>2021 - Character representing the sound "Ra" added to the Baybayin Unicode block</h3>
        <p>áœ‡ was originaly used interchangably for the sound of RA and DA. However, as language evolves, writing must adapt. The use of the Ra sound became more common and many regions, Bicol in particular, who use the sound Ra often in their dialect, began using their own variation of Baybayin called Basahan with it's own character for RA.</p>

        <h3>2021 - Pamudpod added to the Baybayin Unicode block</h3>
        <p>Although Baybayin already has a virama in the form of the Kudlit, many believed adding the Pamudpod would be beneficial for the script. This is because the Krus-Kudlit is quite small and can be hard to differentiate from a regular Kudlit. More importantly, however, the Krus-Kudlit was forced upon the script and is a vestige of our colonized past. <br> <br> While European anthropologist Anton Postma introduced the Pamudpod, it was naturally accepted rather than forced upon, which was a huge step in decolonizing Suyat. Additionally, while Postma indeed introduced it, the character was already present in the Philippines as it was extensively used in Kawi, which is said to be the origin of Suyat scripts. </p>
