    <h2>Links in chronological order</h2>
    <p>The Kawi script is a historical Brahmi-based script found in various inscriptions and artefacts produced between the 8th and the 16th century in insular Southeast Asia. A large portion of its corpus is found in Java, but Kawi materials have also been found in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, and the Philippines. (acording to unicode) </p>
    <p>Kawi is the oldest recorded writing system in the Philippine archipelago and is said to be the origine of most Suyat scripts. In fact, many similarities can be seen when comparing Kawi characters to other Suyat systems</p>

        <h3>900 - Laguna Copperplate Inscription (LCI)</h3>
        <p>The Laguna Copperplate is the oldest evidence of writting in the Philippines. The LCI was written in a combination of Sanskrit, Old Malay, Old Javanese and Old Tagalog and records a dept being acquitted. This is suggests that the archipelago already had societies with international trading networks and possibly used Kawi as a lingua franca to comunicate between city possibly reaching as far as states reaching as far as Java. </p>

        <h3>1002 - Butuan Ivory Seal (BIS) and the Rajahnate of Butuan</h3>
        <p>The seal with it's stylized Kawi script shows that Rajahnate of Butuan was an important trading center in the region as the seal might have been used documenting trade. It also shows that Kawi might have been used as a sort of lingua franca within the archipelago for the purpose of trade and commerce. This, would aligne with the laguna Copperplate, which was found in a different region (pridominantly tagalo) further to the north that also used old Malay written in Kawi. <br> <br>These relations are significant as they can help us understand what cultures and circumstances might have influenced the evolution of Suyat scripts down the line</p>
