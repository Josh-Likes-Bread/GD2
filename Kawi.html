    <h2>Links in chronological order</h2>
    <p>The Kawi script is a historical Brahmi-based script found in various inscriptions and artefacts produced between the 8th and the 16th century in insular Southeast Asia. A large portion of its corpus is found in Java, but Kawi materials have also been found in Sumatra, the Malay Peninsula, Bali, and the Philippines. (acording to unicode) </p>
    <p>Kawi is the oldest recorded writing system in the Philippine archipelago and is said to be the origine of most Suyat scripts. In fact, many similarities can be seen when comparing Kawi characters to other Suyat systems</p>

        <p>The Laguna Copperplate is the oldest evidence of writting in the Philippines. The LCI was written in a combination of Sanskrit, Old Malay, Old Javanese and Old Tagalog. This is conclusive evidence that, at the time of the inscription’s writing, the Philippines was already a society with international trading networks.</p>
