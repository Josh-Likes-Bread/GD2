    <h2>Links in chronological order</h2>
    <p>The Hanunóo script is used by the Mangyan peoples of Mindoro, South Philippines, to write the Hanunóo language. It is one of the few indigenous Philippine scripts which has not been replaced by the Latin script. Its history is difficult to trace in detail due to the perishable nature of bamboo, the surface on which it is traditionally inscribed. (https://scriptsource.org/)</p>

        <h3>1950 - Pamudpod character introduced into the Hanunoo script</h3>
        <p>In his efforts to revitalize the script, Dutch anthropologist Anton Postma,  best known for deciphering the Laguna Copperplate Inscription, introduced the Pamudpod to the script. The character was taken from Kawi script, which he had expert knowledge of after his work with the LCI. <br> <br>
        The Pamudpod is a Virma, a character to suppress the inherent vowel in syllabic scripts that otherwise occurs with every consonant letter
